# AmazingLife
This programming project is a simulation of John Conwayâ€™s Game of  Life. The Game of Life consists of determining the configuration of a series of generations taking place 
on a rectangular grid where each cell is either empty or occupied by an organism. Whether a cell is occupied in a generation is determined by certain rules related to the occupancy of neighboring cells in the preceding generation.This program shows how an initial configuration will change over a series of  generations.
